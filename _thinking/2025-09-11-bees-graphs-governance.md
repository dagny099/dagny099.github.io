**Abstract (30 sec).** A beehive is a data system: noisy observations, seasonal dynamics, tight feedback loops. By treating photos, weather, and notes as **first‑class, related entities** (a *graph*), we turn anecdotes into **evidence‑ready decisions**. The same pattern hardens enterprise analytics: clearer lineage, less hand‑waving, more trust.

<details><summary><strong>Overview (2 min)</strong></summary>

- **Problem.** Real‑world data arrives messy and context‑poor (images, timestamps, half‑remembered notes).  
- **Idea.** Model the *relationships* explicitly—photos ↔ conditions ↔ events—so patterns become queryable.  
- **Payoff.** Faster sense‑making (what changed, when, under what conditions), portable documentation, and governance that’s baked into the model—not tacked on.

</details>

## 1) From “piles of stuff” to a knowledge graph
**Artifacts:** photos (EXIF), weather snapshots, inspections, interventions, outcomes.  
**Relationships:** *observed_during*, *preceded_by*, *co‑occurs_with*, *causes*, *measured_at*.  
**Result:** you can ask *joined* questions: *“Show me high‑humidity inspections within 24h of reduced foraging.”*

> Design mantra: *Name the things; name the links; make both queryable.*

### Minimal entity set (adapt for any domain)
- **Observation** (photo, note) → `time`, `source`, `signals`  
- **Context** (weather, location) → `temp`, `humidity`, `lat/lon`  
- **Event** (intervention, incident) → `type`, `magnitude`, `target`  
- **Outcome** (metric) → `value`, `window`

## 2) Governance you don’t have to remember
Governance isn’t a checklist—it’s a side‑effect of good modeling.

- **Lineage by construction.** Every edge carries provenance (who/what/when).  
- **Schema as communication.** One diagram + short glossary beats 10 pages of prose.  
- **Reproducibility guardrails.** Lockfile + environment file + small, typed transforms.

### Reusable checklist
- [ ] **Name & define** entities/relations (one‑page glossary).  
- [ ] **Capture provenance** fields on ingest (source, version, timestamp, transform ID).  
- [ ] **Store context** next to observations (don’t lose weather/time/place).  
- [ ] **Lock** the environment (Poetry) and **auto‑load** secrets (.env + direnv).  
- [ ] **Document** one query per decision the system should support.

## 3) UX for analytics: show joins, not just charts
A single chart rarely answers “so what?”. Pair **evidence trails** with visuals:

- A *timeline* that shows observations and events in one track.  
- An *evidence table*: claim → linked observations → provenance columns.  
- A *compare view*: “this week vs. last under similar conditions”.

```
Claim: "Reduced activity is humidity-related"
Evidence:
- 2024-08-13 07:10 photo → EXIF humidity 76% (NOAA) → less forager count vs. baseline
- 2024-08-14 07:15 photo → humidity 78% → similar reduction
Provenance: ingest_v0.3 · weather_api v2.1 · camera iPhone15 · tz:America/Denver
```

## 4) Porting the pattern to enterprise analytics
- **Customer ops:** Tickets ↔ changes ↔ incidents → defensible post‑mortems.  
- **Marketing analytics:** Creative ↔ segment ↔ outcome → fewer attribution myths.  
- **Finance:** Transaction ↔ control ↔ exception → auditable adjustments.

> If you can’t draw the **entities** and **relations** cleanly, you can’t govern the system cleanly.

## 5) A tiny start (that scales)
1. Pick one **decision** your team cares about.  
2. List the **entities** and **edges** that decision touches.  
3. Ingest a **week** of data with provenance fields.  
4. Build one **evidence table** and one **timeline**.  
5. Write the **one‑page glossary**. Repeat.
