highlight: "'There exists depths, or phases, of scribing that directly correlate with attention." 
takeaway: "This is a RECIPE or PATTERN for using depth-of-processing in a specifically intuitive, non-threatening (to my shaky drawing skills), and pragmatic approach to WRITING or DRAWING. Basically, this is a way to think more deeply about something, and an invitation to bring a multimodal, sensory and/or emotional integrative framework to that."

It's a new year and I have a renewed motivation to start developing my sketchnoting skills... Via Doug Neill's newsletter, I came across this post from Kelvy Bird (want to explore more of his work). 

Snippets from [Kelvy's excellent post, read it](https://kelvybird.com/4-levels-of-scribing/):

## THING #1: 
<blockquote>
  <h3>There exist depths, or phases, of scribing that directly correlate with attention.</h3>

Different “levels” of listening can help us participate in a shift of awareness and possibility. Otto Scharmer has described four levels of listening: (1) downloading; (2) factual listening; (3) empathic listening; and (4) generative listening.

Kelvy's post turns that idea into a 4-step process to apply each level of listening to the visual practice of scribing, and his article-visual (this header) is an excellent example.


## THING #2: 
<blockquote>
  <h3>Match the level of scribing to the needs of the situation.</h3>

I would not show up for a summer picnic wearing a down jacket and carrying snowshoes. Likewise, I would not expect to exercise generative scribing in a thirty-minute introduction, where three people had eight minutes each to set up their content expertise. Different settings require different approaches. And each level of scribing has a value and relevant application.

Level one scribing is great for conferences where presentations are short and multiple people share their thoughts in bursts. (See Generative Scribing appendix Figure 22.)

Level two scribing is useful for panel discussions, academic lectures, negotiations, strategic planning, even system mapping. (See appendix Figure 23.)

Level three scribing is relational, emphasizing the interaction between elements. It’s a useful approach in storytelling, dialogue, culture mapping. (See appendix Figure 24.)

And with level four scribing, we draw what must be drawn in the developing reality, representing the absolute present moment as it unfolds, in right time. (See appendix Figure 25.) It’s useful in ongoing large-scale change initiatives, cross-sector and multi-stakeholder settings, contexts of societal transformation.
