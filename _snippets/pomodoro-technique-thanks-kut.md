highlight: "When the Pomodoro rings, mark an X on a piece of paper and stop working for 3 - 5 minutes.  The Pomodoro ring signals that the current activity is definitely (though temporarily) finished.  You are not allowed to keep on working 'for just a few minutes' even if you are convinced that in those few minutes you could complete the task at hand. " 
takeaway: "OMG I SO NEED THIS - Can I actually do it??"

Another one of those I <3 my public radio station so much -- Today, Marnie Castor introduced me to the **Pomodoro Technique** (developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980's). 

⏲️ Open the [Pomodoro Web Timer](https://pomodoro.pomodorotechnique.com/)

I quite liked [this breakdown on the Wellness Resources](https://guides.libraries.emory.edu/c.php?g=1365627&p=10088719#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Pomodoro%20Method?%20Pronounced%20poh%2Dmoh%2DDOH%2Droh,the%20break%20is%20expanded%20to%2015%20minutes.) from Emory University's MacMillan Law Library. Also just liked their website for its clear IA, made my brain happy :) particularly because the actual branded website is extremely commercialized. Core snippets below:

## The Core Process of the Pomodoro Technique consists of six steps:

### 1. Choose a Task You Would Like to Get Done.

Something big, something small, something you've been putting off for a million years: it doesn't matter.  What matters is that it's something that deserves your full, undivided attention.

### 2. Set the Pomodoro for 25 Minutes

Make a small oath to yourself: I will spend 25 minutes on this task and I will not interrupt myself.  I can do it!  After all, it's just 25 minutes.

### 3. Work on the Task Until the Pomodoro Rings

Immerse yourself in the task for the next 25 minutes.  If you suddenly realize you have something else you need to do, write the task down on a sheet of paper.

### 4. When the Pomodoro Rings, Put a Checkmark on a Paper

Congratulations!  You've spent an entire, interruption-less Pomodoro on a task.

### 5. Take a Short Break

Breathe, meditate, grab a cup of coffee, go for a short walk or do something else relaxing (i.e. not work related).  Your brain will thank you later.

### 6. Every 4 Pomodoros, Take a Longer Break

Once you've completed four Pomodoros, you can take a longer break.  Twenty minutes is good.  Or 30.  Your brain will use this time to assimilate new information and rest before the next round of Pomodoros.

## The Six Goals of the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is organized into [Six Incremental Goals](https://guides.libraries.emory.edu/c.php?g=1365627&p=10088719#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Pomodoro%20Method?%20Pronounced%20poh%2Dmoh%2DDOH%2Droh,the%20break%20is%20expanded%20to%2015%20minutes.):

     Goal #1 - Find out how much effort an activity requires.

     Goal #2 - Cut down on interruptions.

     Goal #3 - Estimate the effort for activities.

     Goal #4 - Make the Pomodoro more effective.

     Goal #5 - Set up a timetable.

     Goal #6 - Define your own objectives.
