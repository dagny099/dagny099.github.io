 I recently discovered the work of [Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/) and it's been like a treasure trove, I'm never dissapointed. This inverview with an app founder made me curious about it so I quickly wanted to jot down the snippet and make it easier to sign up (ASAP! sounds super interesting and exactly how I work). 
 
 Gregorio Zanon is the founder of [Popt](https://www.popt.app/), a mobile notes app built for seamlessly connecting ideas, contacts, places and time.

Snippets from [Tools for Thought interview, read the whole thing](https://nesslabs.com/popt-featured-tool):

## THING #1: 
<blockquote>
  <h3>"Note-taking should work the way your mind works”</h3>

Now, of course we don’t know how your mind works.

So we try to do the next best thing – to support diverse note taking flows. ... 

Mobile note-taking is very much its own thing – it’s not about sitting down to write an essay or organize a knowledge base. It’s about capturing thoughts in motion. Say you’re in a conversation, or walking out of a meeting, or halfway through a film, you don’t want an app that makes you think about structure and hierarchies. You just want to jot something down. 

For example, you can use the notepad at the bottom of the screen as a scrapbook to jot down a quick shopping list. Or to start a new page. Or add a note to an existing page. You can name pages and pick cute stickers to make them stand out. But you can also entirely ignore pages and just have a list of plain notes, à la Apple Notes.

With Popt, we want to bring the depth of networked note-taking to mobile, without slowing you down. Instead of hashtags or manual links, you link real-world objects as you type: people, places, dates, movies… Those tags add extra dimensions to your notes, turning them into reminders, contact cards, maps and collections. ...

Your notes should be a safe space. You shouldn’t have to wonder where they’re going or who could read them. ... So we built our own text analysis pipeline that runs entirely on-device. It’s not an AI, but a human-designed layer of tagging suggestions that helps you connect things together without interrupting your flow.
