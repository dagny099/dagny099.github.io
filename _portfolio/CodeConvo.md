  - **Conversation Management**: Built a robust system for saving, loading, and auto-recovering chat histories
  - **Analytics Engine**: Integrated OpenAI's GPT models for automated topic extraction and conversation analysis
  - **Export System**: Created a custom HTML report generator with embedded styling and responsive design

- **Skills:** 
  - **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, HTML/CSS, Markdown
  - **Libraries**: Streamlit, Llama-Index, OpenAI API, AsyncIO
