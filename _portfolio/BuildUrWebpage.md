- **Description**  A modern static website that serves as my digital portfolio and knowledge-sharing hub using Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator. The site leverages [GitHub Pages for hosting](#), enabling automated deployments through git push workflows. **Jekyll** was new to me and I'm very glad to have learned it. It takes simple text files (written in Markdown) and processes them through templatees to generate a complete, static HTML website. Jekyll allows me to focus on creating content while it handles the complexities of site generation, just like I wanted.


By combining Markdown-based content management with the Minimal Mistakes theme framework, I created a responsive platform that emphasizes content while maintaining excellent performance and security standards through built-in HTTPS encryption.

- **Overview:**   Back in 2020, I was searching for a way to have a digital "home base" that would be aesthetically attractive, easy to update, and minimize the annoying parts of coding a responsive modern webpage. That's when I found [GitHub Pages sites](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) and I've been an enthusiastic advocate ever since. 

Online resources were super helpful in some respects but I also found myself scraping together a wealth of information sources in order to correctly configure my local development environment, my publishing workflow over multiple environments, as well as learning how to make the Jekyll theme configurability work for my purposes. Over time, I aggregated a [list of references]() in the order I wish I would have encountered them.   
* This project page serves as a description of the deliverable and it's core related competencies. 
* I created an accompanying end-to-end [Tutorial: How to Build a SEO friendly site hosted on GitHub pages](/blog/).
