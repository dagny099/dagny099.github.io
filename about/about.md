## Barbara Hidalgo-Sotelo

**Data scientist with a governance mindset who turns fuzzy business priorities into shippable, explainable AI products.** I sit with doers and execs, translate priorities into plans I (or a team) can implement, and iterate with clear checkpoints for approval or realignment.

### Snapshot (≈80 words)
I build data products that people actually use. My happy place is the seam between analysis and product—where clear questions, clean data, and pragmatic ML meet explainable UX. I’m strong in Python, Streamlit, graph/metadata work (Neo4j), and evaluation. Colleagues count on me to translate business priorities into iterations that ship and to keep governance/documentation tight enough for real-world teams.
