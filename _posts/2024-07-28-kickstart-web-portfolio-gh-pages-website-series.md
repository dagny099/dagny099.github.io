As a data scientist, you're probably comfortable with Jupyter notebooks and GitHub repositories. But let's be honest – sending someone a repo link isn't exactly the most elegant way to showcase your work. What if you could have a beautiful, professional website that's as easy to update as pushing to a repository? Enter GitHub Pages.

## Digital Home Base Motivations

Back in 2020, I was drowning in a sea of options for building my online presence. WordPress felt bloated, Medium wasn't customizable enough, and hand-coding a responsive website seemed like overkill. That's when I discovered GitHub Pages, and it turned out to be the perfect solution for a data professional's needs.

What makes it click for data people? It's version control native (if you can git push, you can update your website), Markdown-based (just like your notebooks!), and perfect for embedding visualizations and code snippets. Plus, it's free, secure (HTTPS by default), and looks professional with custom domain support.

## The Building Blocks: Understanding Your Site

Before we dive into setup, let's peek at what makes up a GitHub Pages site:

```
yoursite.github.io/
├── _config.yml           # Your site's control center
├── index.md              # Your homepage
├── _posts/               # Where your blog posts live
├── _pages/               # Static pages (About, Portfolio)
├── _data/               # Site data files
│   └── navigation.yml   # Navigation structure
└── assets/             # Images and other media
```

Think of it like a well-organized data project: your configuration goes in `_config.yml`, your content lives in `_posts` and `_pages`, and all your assets have their proper place. Simple, right?

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Basic Git knowledge (if you can commit and push, you're ready)
- A GitHub account
- A text editor
- Basic terminal familiarity

### Step 1: Create Your Repository
1. Log into GitHub
2. Create a new repository named `yourusername.github.io` -- The name is crucial – it must match this format exactly!

### Step 2: Set Up Your Theme
We'll use Minimal Mistakes (clean, professional, great for data visualization). Fork the [starter repository](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter), rename it to `yourusername.github.io`, and:

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
git push -u origin main
```


### Step 3: Initial Configuration
The `_config.yml` file is your website's control center. Here's a minimal configuration to get started:

### Step 3: Configure
In `_config.yml`, set up your basics:

```yaml
title: Your Name
subtitle: "Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer"
description: "Personal website and blog about data science"
url: "https://yourusername.github.io"
```


### Step 4: Add Your First Content
Create your first blog post:
1. Create a new file in `_posts/2024-02-15-first-post.md`
2. Add front matter and content:

```markdown
 ---
 title: "Why Every Data Scientist Needs a Blog"
 date: 2024-02-15
 categories:
   - blog
 tags:
   - data science
   - writing
   - career
 ---

Your content here in Markdown format...
```

Don't overthink it – start with something like "Why I Love Data" or "My Journey into Machine Learning". The beauty of GitHub Pages is you can always update it later!

### Step 5: Deploy Your Site

1. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add initial content"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages"
   - Under "Build and deployment", select:
     - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
     - Branch: "main" (or your preferred branch)
   - Click Save

3. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to build your site
4. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io` to see your live site!

## Common Gotchas
- Repository must be named exactly `yourusername.github.io`
- Always check your YAML indentation in `_config.yml`
- Be patient after pushing – builds take a few minutes
- When local testing and not seeing an expected change, it can be helpful to delete "_site" and rebuild again. 


## Next Steps

In [Post 2: Jekyll Deep Dive](/posts/understanding-your-jekyll-site/), we'll explore:
- Setting up your local development environment
- Customizing your theme
- Working with collections and layouts
- Adding dynamic features
- Optimizing for search engines

In other posts, I'd like to cover: 
- **Content Organization**: Set up collections for projects and papers
- **Local Testing**: Set up a local development environment (we'll cover this in Post 2)
- **Analytics**: Add Google Analytics to track your reach
