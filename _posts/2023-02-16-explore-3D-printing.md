## At-Home Additive Manufacturing
{: style="margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0px;"} 

Curiosity was sparked by a Kickstarter campaign by AnkerMake in the fall of 2022.   

This is my printer: the [M5 AnkerMake ](https://www.ankermake.com/uk/products/m5)

_Lessons in progress_:
- Best initial 3D prints to motiviate and delight
- Most important slicer settings to understand
- Editing STL models with 3d modeling software (starting with [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/))

##### More to come soon:
- Network graph based on schema.org showing objects to print
- List of awesome resources for learning slicing settings
