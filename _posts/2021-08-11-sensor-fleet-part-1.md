# Objective
This project shows you how to build a fleet of IoT temperature sensors that you can use to answer potentially burning questions, like:
* Do I trust thermostat reading on my wall?
* Do different rooms in my house have similar cooling profiles?
* What's the relationship between how hot it is outside and how much electricity is used?

## Part 1: Build a sensor, Publish the data
After this post, you'll be able to:
* Publish temperature sensor measurements powered by an Arduino
* Read the sensor readings using the MQTT protocol
* Create a mysql database to store the measurements
* Write incoming measurements to the database

## Things You'll Need:
