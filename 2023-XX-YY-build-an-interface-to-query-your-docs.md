## At-Home Additive Manufacturing

I did it!! I’m super happy to have set this goal for myself and I finished the CloudWolf CCP Prep course and passed the exam. 

My experience with the exam was that, while not exactly “easy”, I felt confident throughout the exam. I took the test on a Saturday afternoon (location: Austin, TX) and the hardest part was that the building was locked upon arrival. After making  frantic calls to the testing center, I realized there was a 4-digit code at the bottom of the long Pearson Vue confirmation email (which I neglected to read through to the end). So, I learned my lesson; just a heads up for any test-takers in testing centers on Saturdays :)  

As for the test itself— Definite emphasis on the Well Architected framework, and I was glad to have memorized the services in the final few sections of the CCP Prep course (esp the Automation & Dev Tools, but also Management & Governance). Also knowing the support provided in the AWS Support Plans. 

I highly recommend working through the CloudWolf Practice exams and any others you can find! Thanks again to Kirill and Hadelin for the inspiration to buckle down for this exam, plus a shout out to Ana and lots of luck to others.
