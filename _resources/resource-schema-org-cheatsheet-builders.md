### What's inside
- The YAML → JSON-LD mental model
- The three schema types this site emits (and how they're selected)
- High-impact field mapping (what matters most)
- Validation steps (View Source, Rich Results Test, Schema Validator)
- Where it lives in the repo (`_includes/schema.html`, etc.)

> Tip: Pair this with the interactive demo at `/assets/visualizations/schema-examples.html`.
