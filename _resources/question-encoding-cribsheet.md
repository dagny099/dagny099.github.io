## What's Inside

A compact reference mapping question types to effective visual encodings:

| Question Type | Best Encodings |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Comparison** | Bar charts, dot plots, slope graphs |
| **Distribution** | Histograms, density plots, box plots |
| **Relationship** | Scatter plots, connected scatter, bubble charts |
| **Composition** | Stacked bars, treemaps, waffle charts |
| **Change over time** | Line charts, area charts, sparklines |

Plus guidance on when to break the rules and why.

## Cognitive Principle

**Information Architecture** — The human visual system processes different encodings at different speeds. Position is fastest, then length, then angle, then area. This crib sheet helps you match your question to encodings that leverage fast perception channels.

## When to Use

Keep this next to your desk when designing dashboards or exploratory visualizations. Before reaching for your default chart type, check if there's a better encoding for your specific question.
