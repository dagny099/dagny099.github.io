## What's Inside

A one-page checklist covering the essentials of accessible color use in data visualization:

- **Contrast ratios** — WCAG-compliant thresholds for text and graphical elements
- **Color blindness simulation** — Quick tests before publishing
- **Redundant encoding** — Using shape, pattern, or labels alongside color
- **Common pitfalls** — Red/green palettes, low-contrast legends, gradient traps

## Cognitive Principle

**Perception & Visual Processing** — Color discrimination varies significantly across individuals. What looks obviously distinct to you may be indistinguishable to 8% of your male audience. This checklist ensures your visual hierarchy survives varied color perception.

## When to Use

Run through this checklist before publishing any dashboard, report, or presentation that relies on color to convey meaning.
