## What's Inside

A printable template and design guide for small multiples layouts:

- **Grid sizing** — How many panels before cognitive overload kicks in
- **Axis alignment** — Shared vs. independent scales and when to use each
- **Labeling strategy** — Title placement, annotation, and highlighting
- **Spacing ratios** — Gestalt principles applied to panel arrangement

## Cognitive Principle

**Pattern Recognition** — Humans excel at detecting patterns when comparisons are spatially adjacent rather than temporally sequential (flipping between tabs). Small multiples leverage this by showing all variations simultaneously, letting the eye do the comparison work.

## When to Use

Use small multiples whenever you're tempted to:
- Create a single chart with 10+ overlapping lines
- Build a dropdown selector for different categories
- Animate through time periods

In each case, small multiples likely outperform the "clever" alternative.
