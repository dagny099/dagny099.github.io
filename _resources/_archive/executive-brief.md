## What’s inside
- Tight one-page brief with problem, options, decision, and evidence.
- Checklist to avoid “hallucination theater.”
- Section for **assumptions**, **risks**, and **next check-in**.

## How to apply
Use this for weekly leadership syncs or project kickoff. Start with evidence links and keep the brief short enough to read out loud.
