## Why This Format?

This CHANGELOG follows industry best practices:

1. **Chronological Organization**: Grouped by month/quarter with newest changes first
2. **Semantic Categories**: Uses "Added", "Changed", "Fixed" to clarify the nature of changes
3. **Human-Readable**: Focuses on features and user-facing changes rather than raw commit messages
4. **Contextual Grouping**: Related commits are grouped into logical features
5. **Highlights Major Initiatives**: Clear sections for significant projects like the Snippets System or IA overhaul

The format makes it easy to:
- Understand what changed and when
- Track major features and improvements over time
- See patterns in development (e.g., heavy design work in late 2025)
- Share updates with collaborators or in documentation
