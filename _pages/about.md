I'm a data scientist and software consultant with experience in machine learning, eye tracking, and dashboarding for business intelligence. I'm also a marathon-runner, bilingual Toastmaster, and deputy voter registrar. Austin is where the magic typically happens but "Love Data, Will Travel" is my motto. 

My background includes studying cognitive science at MIT's Brain and Cognitive Science department, a fun transition in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and a return to my alma matter, the University of Texas at Austin, working in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders. 

Since 2014, I've consulted on enterprise software UI for the business management and healthcare industries. And when called upon, I've enjoyed serving as a project manager within the media marketing and risk management industries.

TL/DR: I have a passion for learning and helping others learn. Reach out if like-minded.
