# From Seeing → Knowing → Building
I started in **vision science** (MIT PhD) studying how people *see* and decide. Today I build **data systems** that help teams *know* and act — with governance, usability, and explainability baked in.

<summary><h2>Throughlines I Live By</h2></summary>

- **Levels of Analysis (Marr):** I switch between *computational goal*, *algorithm & representation*, and *implementation* — from human vision models to analytics pipelines.  
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Tools should respect human limits & strengths. I design for adoption.  
- **Data → Decisions:** Experiments → metrics → stories → action.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Timeline Highlights (Research → Applied)</h2></summary>

- **MIT · PhD (Vision/Cognition):** modeled gaze across 900+ scenes; learned discipline in hypothesis, controls, and measurement.  
- **UT Austin · Research Engineer:** built speech-processing tools & GUIs used by a dozen+ researchers; automated repeatable analysis.  
- **Persis Consulting · Product/QA/Training:** translated business needs to software requirements; improved QA and adoption with better docs.  
- **Inflective · PM (Healthcare Ops):** digital transformation for ~4M bills/yr; ML doc classification; Lean Six Sigma workshops.  
- **MediaScience · Research PM:** eye tracking + GSR + facial expressions; pipelines & client reporting.  
- **Metric5 (SEC) · Data Scientist:** Python + PowerBI reporting; ServiceNow integrations; metadata pipelines & glossary for catalog adoption.  
- **Inflective · Technical Consultant:** GA4 → Looker Studio; process maps for ERP transition; UX/content insights.

<summary><h2>How Cognitive Science Still Shapes My Work</h2></summary>

- **Experimental Rigor:** hypotheses, controls, and validation plans for analytics & ML.  
- **Visual Processing Insights:** design dashboards that *match* human attention.  
- **Systems Thinking:** tie features to user tasks and business outcomes; ship explainable artifacts.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Now & Next</h2></summary>

- **Now:** Data products that blend **governance + usability** — metadata pipelines, self-serve dashboards, explainable ML.  
- **Next:** **Knowledge-graph-powered analytics** (entity reconciliation, lineage) and **GenAI copilots** that teach as they help.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Selected Projects</h2></summary>

- **CodeConvo** — Streamlit chat with OpenAI, tidy state mgmt, and conversation analytics.  
- **Workout Analytics** — ETL → MySQL (AWS RDS); distributions, deltas, and trends.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Optional Visuals (Interactive)</h2></summary>

- **TimelineJS** — Map items from `assets/data/barbara_resume_golden.json` → start/end, title, employer, tags.  
- **Skill Evolution** — Sparkline or simple Plotly line chart to highlight the shift from research → applied DS/ML.
