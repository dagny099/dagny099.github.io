# The Decade in My Running Shoes: A Personal Data Archaeology Project
## Part 1: 

*What happens when you finally look at ten years of your own fitness data.*

The Perfect Data Citizen's Confession
I had been the perfect quantified self citizen for a decade. Every run meticulously logged in MapMyRun, every metric tracked, every route recorded. 2,099 workouts spanning ten years of my life, neatly categorized and stored in the cloud.
But here's the embarrassing truth: I had never actually looked at what the data was telling me about my own life.
Sure, I'd glanced at the weekly summaries, celebrated the occasional personal best, maybe checked my monthly mileage. But really explore the patterns hiding in a decade of digital footprints? Never.
That changed when I finally downloaded my complete workout history as a CSV file and stared at the spreadsheet. 2,099 rows of my life, reduced to timestamps, distances, and durations. The data scientist in me was excited. The human in me was overwhelmed.
What stories were hiding in this digital diary I'd been unconsciously writing?
