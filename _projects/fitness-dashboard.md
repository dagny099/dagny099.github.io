## Problem
I had scattered CSVs and subjective training notes. No single weekly view, no trend break detection, and no way to keep promises to “future me.”

## Approach
- Normalize inputs into a tidy model (sessions, metrics, deltas).
- Compute **consistency** and **trend-breaks** with transparent rules.
- Human-centered visuals that emphasize *decisions* rather than dashboards.

## Impact
- Weekly ritual, not a one-off report.
- Early warning on form/volume changes.
- Reduced decision debt and easier experimentation.
