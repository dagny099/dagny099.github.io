Here you'll find a selection of my projects and "mini-projects" (some call them skill-based projects) in data science, machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). 

## Featured Projects

### CodeConvo: Build a configurable chatbot with memory and topic analysis

- **Description:** A Streamlit-based application that enables interactive conversations with Large Language Models (supporting multiple LLM providers) while providing tools for conversation management and analysis. The interface allows users to configure their LLM interactions, save chat histories, and generate topic summaries of their conversations. Serve the application from a remote server and make it accessible from a custom domain that I own.  
- **Key Features:**
  - **Real-time Interaction**: Implemented streaming responses using async Python for fluid conversations
  - **Configurable Interface**: Developed a dynamic settings system for LLM parameters, display options, and UI customization
  - **Conversation Management**: Built a robust system for saving, loading, and auto-recovering chat histories
  - **Analytics Engine**: Integrated OpenAI's GPT models for automated topic extraction and conversation analysis
  - **Export System**: Created a custom HTML report generator with embedded styling and responsive design
- **Skills:** 
  - **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, HTML/CSS, Markdown
  - **Libraries**: Streamlit, Llama-Index, OpenAI API, AsyncIO
  - **Development**: Async Programming, API Integration, State Management
  - **Design**: Content Layout, Report Generation, User Experience
  - **Software Architecture**: Modular Design, Error Handling, Configuration Management, AWS EC2

### Interactive Workout Dashboard backed by AWS Relational Database (RDS)

- **Description:** A full-stack data analytics platform that pulls workout data from my MapMyRun profile into an actionable workout dashboard application. This web application combines data ingestion and cleaning, data modeling and access, and machine learning to help me visualize and understand my training patterns as viewed on my configurable dashboard. 
- **Key Features:**
  - **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: Engineered an ETL pipeline to periodically export workout data from MapMyRun's CSV exports and ingest the new entries (after cleaning and enriching the data) into a structured MySQL database (local and remote versions)
  - **Interactive Analytics Dashboard**: Built a responsive web interface using Streamlit and Plotly tha visualizes key workout metrics and training trends interactively
  - **Practice SQL Queries**: Integrated a way to execute SQL queries via the interactive dashboard to practice SQL query skills using data that I'm personally familiar with and invested in understanding more deeply
  - **Performance Optimization**: Implemented efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms to handle large workout history datasets while maintaining responsive dashboard performance
- **Skills:**
  - **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, Bash scripting, MySQL, AWS EC2 and RDS configuration and management
  - **Data Visualization**: Plotly, Streamlit, Workout metric design and layout
  - **Database**: MySQL, AWS RDS, Data modeling, Query generation
  - **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection for data cleaning, unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms for workout classification
  - **Development Tools**: Poetry for dependency management, Git

### Personal Website & Technical Blog Platform

- **Description:** Designed and published a modern static website that serves as my digital portolio and knowledge-sharing hub using Jekyll, a static site generator. The site uses GitHub Pages for hosting, enabling automated deployments through git push workflows, and is configured to be accessible at my custom domain.  
- **Key Features:**
  - **Statis Site Generator**: Built with Jekyll for efficient site generation and content management 
  - **Hosting & Deployment**: Hosted using GitHub Pages and configured to access via personal domain name and HTTPS security
  - **Version Control**: Git for content and code management
  - **Content Format**: Written in Markdown and uses the Minimal Mistakes theme, which has good UX across devices
  - **Information Architecture**: Designed an intuitive IA to showcase portfolio projects and content effectively
- **Skills:**
  - **Languages & Frameworks**: Jekyll, Markdown, HTML/CSS
  - **Development**: Git workflow, Ruby Gem management, Static Site Configuration
  - **Design**: UX Considerations, Content Layout, Information Architecure Design
  - **Domain Knowledge**: Web Hosting Concepts, Web Security Basics, Statis Site Architecture, DNS Management
