# Welcome to My Personal Website Code

Hola! 👋 Thanks for visting the GitHub repository for my personal website. This is where I host the code for my personal website, which serves as my portfolio and blog.

## About This Site

This website is my digital hub where I share projects, articles, and my musings as a data scientist. It's built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, uses the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme, and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  

## Features

- 📊 Portfolio showcasing my data science projects
- 📝 Blog where I write about data science, knowledge organization, and on occasion current events
- 🐝  Custom design to reflect my personal interests

## How It's Built

Back in 2020, I was searching for a way to have a digital "home base" that would be aesthetically attractive, easy to update, and minimize the annoying parts of coding a responsive modern webpage. That's when I found [GitHub Pages sites](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) and I've been an enthusiastic advocate ever since.  

**GitHub Pages** is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. It's an excellent choice for projects like personal websites, portfolios, and project documentation for several reasons:

🆓 Pricetag = $0 
🔒 Secure (HTTPS by default)  
🔗 Direct integration with GitHub repositories  
🚀 Easy deployment through git push  
🎛️ Custom domain support, yay!


**Jekyll** was new to me and I'm very glad to have learned it. It takes simple text files (written in Markdown) and processes them through templatees to generate a complete, static HTML website. Jekyll allows me to focus on creating content while it handles the complexities of site generation, just like I wanted.

I recommend anyone with a similar requirement set for their webpage to do the GitHub Pages exercise on [GitHub Skills](https://github.com/skills/github-pages).
