*Active projects where cognitive principles meet production code*

### Fitness Intelligence Platform <span class="cognitive-badge">Attention Patterns</span>
**Cognitive Principle**: Pattern recognition through contrast and repetition

When 14 years of running data collided with dog walks, I discovered that human behavior naturally clusters into 3 categoriesâ€”not the 10+ my app offered. The ML classifier doesn't just sort workouts; it mirrors how humans actually categorize effort levels when cognitive load is high (like during exercise).

**Technical**: Python, AWS Lambda, MySQL, Streamlit  
**Cognitive Insight**: The 7Â±2 rule emerges naturally in behavioral data

### Convoscope: Multi-Modal AI Comparison <span class="cognitive-badge">Working Memory</span>
**Cognitive Principle**: Cognitive load management through progressive disclosure

Comparing AI outputs revealed a fundamental limit: humans can effectively compare 3 options, tolerate 5, and get overwhelmed by 7+. This interface respects working memory constraints while managing infinite AI possibilities.

**Technical**: Streamlit, OpenAI/Anthropic/Google APIs, PostgreSQL  
**Cognitive Insight**: Side-by-side comparison reduces cognitive load vs. sequential evaluation

### Beehive Knowledge Graph <span class="cognitive-badge">Associative Memory</span>
**Cognitive Principle**: Human memory is associative, not chronological

Four years of photos became queryable knowledge by modeling how beekeepers actually recall eventsâ€”through associations (weatherâ†’outcomes) rather than dates. The system's 7 relationship types emerged naturally from how humans connect observations.

**Technical**: Neo4j, Google Cloud Vision, Python, Weather APIs  
**Cognitive Insight**: Domain expertise is about relationships, not isolated facts

## ðŸ”¬ Research & Exploration
*Where cognitive science theory meets data science practice*

### Academic Citation Network Prediction <span class="cognitive-badge">Attention Networks</span>
**Cognitive Principle**: Attention mechanisms in knowledge discovery

Using TransE to predict missing citations in a network of 8,000 papers. The model learns "attention patterns" in researchâ€”which ideas researchers notice and which they overlook, despite relevance.

**Technical**: Graph Neural Networks, PyTorch, Neo4j, Semantic Scholar API  
**Cognitive Insight**: Academic attention follows predictable patterns, just like visual attention

## ðŸ“š Foundational Builds
*Earlier projects that established my cognitive approach*

### IoT Temperature Sensor Fleet (2021)
**Cognitive Principle**: Real-time data needs real-time comprehension

Built a distributed sensor network that taught me: streaming data is only valuable if humans can process it at the speed it arrives. Led to my focus on progressive disclosure and attention management.

[â†’ 6-Part Series](/posts/sensor-fleet/)

### Digital Portfolio Workshop Series (2024)  
**Cognitive Principle**: Information architecture as cognitive architecture

Teaching others to build portfolio sites revealed how cognitive principles apply to personal branding and content organization.

## The Cognitive Thread

Every project here demonstrates the same truth: **the best technical solution considers human cognition first**.

Whether it's chunking workout data into 3 categories, limiting AI comparisons to working memory capacity, or organizing beehive observations like human memory worksâ€”the pattern is consistent. Technology succeeds when it aligns with how humans naturally think.
